This repo houses a library of accessibility automation examples that use multiple different testing frameworks.

## Purpose

To help developers build a better automated accessibiltiy testing process. Too many times teams stop at simply adding a singular test 
case to their UI tests. We want to build a better more robust set of automated accessibiltiy tests, and this library can help you build those out. 

## Structure

The examples are currently categorized by different levels of test and test engines.
